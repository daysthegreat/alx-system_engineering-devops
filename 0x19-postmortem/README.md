Postmortem

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: April 10, 2024, 14:30 UTC
End Time: April 10, 2024, 18:45 UTC

Impact:
The outage affected the core functionality of our e-commerce platform.
Users experienced intermittent connectivity issues, slow page loads, and 30% of the user base was affected.

Root Cause:
An unanticipated surge in traffic triggered a cascading failure in our microservices architecture, leading to database overload.

Timeline:

14:30 UTC:
The issue was initially detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in database latency.

14:35 UTC:
Investigation began with a focus on the database cluster, assuming a potential database misconfiguration.

15:00 UTC:
Misleading Path: A database misconfiguration was ruled out, but attention shifted to the application layer, suspecting a flaw in recent code deployments.

15:45 UTC:
Escalation: The incident was escalated to the DevOps and Database Engineering teams as the root cause remained elusive.

16:30 UTC:
Further Misdirection: Investigations into recent code deployments and database queries failed to pinpoint the issue.

17:15 UTC:
Escalation to Senior Engineers: With no clear resolution in sight, senior engineers from multiple teams were brought in to collaborate on the investigation.

18:00 UTC:
Root Cause Identified: The surge in traffic led to an unprecedented number of concurrent database connections, causing a resource bottleneck.

18:45 UTC:
Resolution: Implementing connection pooling and scaling the database horizontally resolved the issue. Normal system functionality was restored.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The surge in traffic overwhelmed the database with an unexpected number of concurrent connections, leading to a bottleneck.

Resolution:
Implemented connection pooling to efficiently manage and reuse database connections.
Horizontally scaled the database infrastructure to handle increased traffic.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Strengthen monitoring for database connection metrics and set up automated alerts for abnormal spikes.
Conduct a thorough review of the system's scalability and implement measures to gracefully handle traffic surges.

Tasks:
Implement automated scaling policies for critical components of the infrastructure.
Conduct a post-incident review with all teams involved to enhance collaboration and response efficiency.
Enhance documentation on system architecture and potential scalability challenges.
Initiate a comprehensive traffic forecasting analysis to anticipate and proactively handle future traffic spikes.
Establish a dedicated incident response team with clear roles and responsibilities.

Conclusion:
This incident highlighted the need for a more robust and proactive approach to handle unexpected surges in traffic. By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to fortify our system against similar incidents in the future and ensure a more resilient and responsive web stack.
